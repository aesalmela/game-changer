# Game Changer Script

A script to switch all games between "game" and "scrimmage".

The script can be used to toggle so that coaches can generate stats. Scrimmages don't generate stats so it is useful to set all games as scrimmages if parents are scoring games and you prefer to not disclose stats to parents. 

### Parameter
-type game
- will set games to "game"

-type scrimmage
- will set games to "scrimmage"
